</li><li>Revoke any such license
</li></ol>
<p>Where an order under sub-section (1) is made, the holder of a driving license shall forthwith surrender his driving license to the licenseing authority making the order, if the driving license has not already been surrendered, and the licensing authority shall, - 
</p>
<ol type="A"><li>If the driving license is a driving license issued under this Act, keep it until the disqualification has expired or has been removed; or
</li><li>If it is not a driving license issued under this Act, endorse the disqualification upon it and send it to the licensing authority by which it was issued, or
</li><li>In the case of revocation of any license, endorse the revocation upon it and if it is not the authority which issued the same, intimate the fact of the revocation to the authority which issued that license:
</li></ol>
<p>
Provided that where the driving license of a person authorizes him to drive more than once class or description of motor vehicles and the order, made under sub-section (1), disqualifies him from driving any specified class or description of motor vehicles, the licensing authority shall endorse the disqualification upon the driving license and return the same to the holder.
